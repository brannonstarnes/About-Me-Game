      <header>A Little Bio</header>
      My name is Brannon Starnes, I'm 36 years old and currently living in
      Washington state. I was born in Texas, moved to Japan, Utah, Florida and
      Tennesse by the time I was in first grade. My family settled down in
      Tennessee, where I stayed until I was 22, at which point I moved to Salt
      Lake City, UT to attend the University of Utah.

      <header>My Education</header>
      <ul>
        <li>University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 2003-2004 - Nursing</li>
        <li>University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, 2004-2006 - Nursing</li>
        <li> University of Utah, Salt Lake City, 2007-2009 - B.S. Adventure and Outdoor Programming</li>
      </ul>
      <!--
      Speaking of education, I started my freshman year at the University of
      Tennessee studying Nursing. After working in a hospital for about a year,
      I realized this was not the field for me. That was the point in my life
      where I decided to pack it all up and head for Utah, to study and
      eventually obtain a Bachelor of Science in Adventure and Outdoor
      Programming, or as my mom would call it, "camping". Although it may sound
      like my studies included singing "Kumbaya" and making campfires, the
      degree gave me the skills to teach others how to develop the tools to
      learn and grow.-->
